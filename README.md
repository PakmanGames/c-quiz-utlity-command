# Quiz Utility Command
This was a project for the *The CI Pipeline Assignment* for the 2XC3 Development basics course.  
In this project, I learned to create a utility command in C to quiz the user and get their responses through the CLI. In addition to this, I created GitHub actions test scripts to test various features of the utility command.

### How to use the utility command
Here's how to use the utility:  
`$ quiz --help` to get the link for help

`$ quiz -1` to get the text for the first question

`$ quiz -2` to get the text for the second question

`$ quiz -3` to get the test for the third question

`$ quiz [-#] "my answer"` to answer a question where `[-#]` is either `-1`, `-2`, or `-3`
